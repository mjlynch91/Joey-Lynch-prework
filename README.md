Module-1_Assessment: A website made of three webpages. Index.html is a short autobiography, portfolio.html is just some images, and contact.html is some input boxes. It is all to test basic knowledge of html and css. It was intended to have specific look and feel to match given images.

Module 2 Assesment: This program runs a hangman style game on index.html.  The user is given a certain number of guesses.
The user must guess all the letters in the word before the guesses run out. The word is chosen randomly out of a 
list of words I made up. 
The code is organized into 2 sections.
The first section is where I declare and define all functions. The second section is where the "main" program is.
I'm used to coding in C so that why I broke it up this way, because that's how it's done in C.
