prework for Dev10

Module 2 Assesment: This program runs a hangman style game on index.html.  The user is given a certain number of guesses.
The user must guess all the letters in the word before the guesses run out. The word is chosen randomly out of a 
list of words I made up. 
The code is organized into 2 sections.
The first section is where I declare and define all functions. The second section is where the "main" program is.
I'm used to coding in C so that why I broke it up this way, because that's how it's done in C.
