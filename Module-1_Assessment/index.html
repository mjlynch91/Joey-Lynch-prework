                    My name is Joey Lynch. I grew up in Fargo, ND and joined the Marine Corps after high school. After my four year enlistment I went to University of Colorado Boulder to study chemistry. I recieved my B.S. in chemistry, graduating summa cum laude, in 2017. After that I went to University of Minneasota Twin Cities to study chemistry in grad school. I started coding while in grad school and enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the chemistry, so I decided to switch my carrerr.

                    <p>In my spare time I like to automate my house with IoT devices. That is actually part of the reason, I find coding interesting. To program microcontrollers to do IoT things, they need to be programmed and I wanted to learn how to do that myself. I also tinker with electronics in my spare time.</p>
                    <p>I have a YouTube channel named Heisenberg's Dog. The content on there is mostly about physical chemisty and spectroscopy, but I'm starting to make more electronics videos.</p>
